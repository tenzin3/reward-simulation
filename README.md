## Random Walk Simulation Script
### Overview
This script simulates a random walk process. It starts from an initial value of 0 and makes a series of steps (either adding or subtracting 1) based on weighted probabilities influenced by a reward system. The goal is to explore how the system evolves over multiple steps and iterations.

The inspiration came to me from this [AI learn how to box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsJ_AusntiU) video.
